Each Minesweeper game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares.
After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear,
some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them.
It's your job to use the numbers to figure out which of the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click.

When inputting the coordinates, you must put the column index first and then row index (column index, row index)
For instance, if user input is 2 1(separated by a space), it means starting from (0,0) moving by column index 2 and row index 1 

Bye!
