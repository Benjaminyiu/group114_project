Introduction: We are going to make a game called Minesweeper using C++

Game Rules: the rule of the game is finding all the mines using the number on a block shows the number of mines adjacent to it

Features: Depending on the difficulty, there will be more mines in a given field
1. Generation of random game sets or events: we will randomly assign mines in the field
2. Data structures for storing game status: we will use 2D-array to store mines in the field
3. Dynamic memory management: (to be added)
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status): (to be added)
5. Program codes in multiple files: (to bea added)
