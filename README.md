# ENGG1340 Game Project
## Name of the game: Minesweeper
## Proposal

Group nember: Yiu Ka Chun, Oh Seungwoo

Introduction: We are going to make a classical game called Minesweeper using C++. 

Game Rules: the rule of the game is finding all the mines without detonating by using the number on a block shows the number of mines adjacent to it.

Features: Depending on the difficulty, there will be more mines in a given field. We plan to offer three difficulty level: easy, medium, and hard.
1. Generation of random game sets or events: we will randomly assign mines in the field
2. Data structures for storing game status: we will use 2D-array to store the mines and numbers in the field
3. Dynamic memory management: (to be added)
4. File input/output (e.g., for loading/saving game status): The performance of player is recognised by how much time he/she played to win the game. The faster the player wins, the higher score he/she can obtain. Players will be asked for their names and ranking will be created in descending order. This ranking will then be saved to a file so that the records won't be erased when players quit the game.
5. Program codes in multiple files: Tha game would be divided into several parts to ensure scalability and easier debugging.
